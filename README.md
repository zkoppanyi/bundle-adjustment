# bundle-adjustment

Under development...

A bundle adjustment implementation for photogrammetric applications. The library is written in C\C++ with Matlab interface to support fast research development. 

# Goals

The goal of the library is to easily change various settings (e.g. known-uknown, constraints) of the photogrammetric network to test its behvaior. The library also supports derving aprior and aposterior stochastic values, and several numerical optimization method for the bundle problem.
